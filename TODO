TODO and Known Issues

* position of panel is not determined correctly (its assumed to be top) 
        -> Main.panel.bottomPosition = true/false
        -> Main.panel2 // if there are two panels enabled
* there seems to be a small offset to the left
        -> maybe a hardcoded default border size which differs in gnome-shell and cinnamon? 
* Preview has a different ratio than the actual screen -> improve that!
        -> also take care of multimonitor environments!

multimonitor support? -> Test it!
